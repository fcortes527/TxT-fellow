        This video is about the famous serires: 1-1+1-1+1-1+1... It's interesting how a series could be logically
        solved to three different sollutions. Even more interesting is that a series consisting of only 1 or 0 for
        any n, could have a sum that is neither! However, for the sum of this series to be 1/2 makes sence in a
        way because it is exactly the average of the other two solutions: 0 and 1.

        refreshing the page. Otherwise, the browser may be incompatible with this file/site. Upon testing and
        development, the video was functioning properly, but it began to be unresponsive towards the end of
        development.
