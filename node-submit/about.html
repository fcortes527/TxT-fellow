    <p class="blue">
      I enjoy taking long runs around campus or pretty much anywhere that my legs can take me. I find running to be a very liberating experience,
      and whenever I get a chance to escape, I take it. Although I enjsoy running because of the solitary mental clarity it can provide, I think that
      a run is best (and easiest) when accompanied by friends. I find motivation in my peers, and they in me; it's a good dynamic.

      I love playing Super Smash Bros. My mains are Ness and Lucas (my characters of choice). I have played all of the iterations of the game up to date,
      and I have to say that Ultimate is perhaps the best. I used to play on my own much more, but of course, the older you get, the busier you get, so now,
      it's not as often that I get to pick up a game of smash. However, whenever I do, which is usually witha large group of friends, it is always a blast.

      Another one of my favorite passtimes is actually cleaning, more specifically, organizing. I find satisfacction in making sure that my living,
      work, as well as leisure environment are crisp and organized. There doesn't necessarly need to be order to everything, so long as all elements in
      my imediate environment serve a purpose and don't suffocate the space.
